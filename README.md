# Data-Driven-Analysis-of-EV-Charging-Infrastructure-for-a-Smart-City
This project conducts a meticulous data-driven analysis, concentrating on the unique challenges and opportunities presented by the charging infrastructure tailored for medium/heavy-duty vehicles within the dynamic context of a smart city.

## Data- Driven Analysis:
Implemented a data-driven analysis with advanced forecasting machine learning models:
- Prophet model for forecasting the vehicle count (EV market analysis)
- Stacking Ensemble Regressor model integrated with weighted fusion for predicting range
- Temporal Fusion Transformer model utilized for energy demand for each charging station
- PuLP linear programming optimization model with K-means clustering for optimal placement of charging stations

## Prophet model for forecasting the Electric vehicle count and charging stations demand
